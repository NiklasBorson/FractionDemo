# FractionDemo

This small sample app demonstrates encapsulation in a C# type, namely
the Fraction struct. The Fraction type encapsulates a ratio of two
integers, exposed via the Numerator and Denominator properties.

Key concepts demonstrated by the Fraction struct are:

- Use of constructors to establish class invariants.
- Exposing a public interface that makes senes for the type, e.g., math operators.
- Use of public and private to separate interface from implementation.

The sample accompanies the following video:
